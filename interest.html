		<div class="int i-0"><p>Machine learning is a trending concept in this era and it focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.<br>
